                         Environment Semantics

Objective:

This lab practices concepts of environment semantics. You'll carry out
derivations using the various rule sets from Chapter 19, and gain
intuition about dynamic versus lexical semantics and how stores work
to allow mutability. The payoff exercises here are Exercises 9, 11,
and 12.

Finally, you'll program a simple implementation of environments --
allowing lookup in and extension of environments -- which may be
helpful with your work on the final project.  *)

(*====================================================================
  Part 1: An environment semantics derivation

In this part, you'll work out the formal derivation of the environment
semantics for the expression

    let x = 3 + 5 in
    (fun x -> x * x) (x - 2)

according to the semantic rules presented in Chapter 19, Figure 19.1,
just as you did in Lab 9, Part 1 for substitution semantics.

Before beginning, what should this expression evaluate to? Test out
your prediction in the OCaml REPL. *)

(* ANSWER: The expression evaluates to 36:

    # let x = 3 + 5 in
        (fun x -> x * x) (x - 2)  ;;
    - : int = 36
*)

(* The exercises will take you through the derivation stepwise, so
that you can use the results from earlier exercises in the later
exercises.

By way of example, we do the first couple of exercises for you to give
you the idea.

......................................................................
Exercise 1. Carry out the derivation for the semantics of the
expression `3 + 5` in an empty environment.
....................................................................*)

(* ANSWER:

    {} ⊢ 3 + 5 ⇓
               | {} ⊢ 3 ⇓ 3       (R_int)
               | {} ⊢ 5 ⇓ 5       (R_int)
               ⇓ 8                (R_+)
*)

(*....................................................................
Exercise 2. Determine the result of evaluating the following
expression `x + 5` in the environment `{x ↦ 3}` by carrying out the
derivation for

    {x ↦ 3} ⊢ x + 5 ⇓ ???
....................................................................*)

(* ANSWER: Carrying out each step in the derivation:

    {x ↦ 3} ⊢ x + 5 ⇓
                    | {x ↦ 3} ⊢ x ⇓ 3    (R_var)
                    | {x ↦ 3} ⊢ 5 ⇓ 5    (R_int)
                    ⇓ 8                  (R_+)

   Again, we've labeled each line with the name of the equation that
   was used from the set of equations in Figure 19.1. You should do
   that too. *)

(*....................................................................
Exercise 3. Carry out the derivation for the semantics of the
expression `let x = 3 in x + 5` in an empty environment.
....................................................................*)

(* ANSWER:

  {} ⊢ let x = 3 in x + 5 ⇓
                          | {} ⊢ 3 ⇓ 3              (R_int)
                          | {x ↦ 3} ⊢ x + 5 ⇓ 8     (Exercise 2)
                          ⇓ 8                       (R_let)

   Note the labeling of one of the steps with the result from a
   previous exercise.
   
   The R_let rule specifies that the environment to be used in the
   third line in this derivation should be E{x → v_D}, where

     * the metavariable E at this point is the empty environment {},
     * the metavariable x is the object variable x
     * the metavariable v_D is 3.

   Extending {} with a mapping of x to 3 gives the environment {x →
   3}, which is exactly the environment that we use in line 3. The
   generation of the extended environment is carried out implicitly,
   the steps in doing so isn't spelled out explicitly here and needn't
   be in your own derivations.
 *)

(* Now it's your turn. We recommend doing these exercises with pencil
on paper. Alternatively, you might share a Google doc and work on
developing the solutions there. After you've worked them out and
verified them with staff, you can later copy them into your lab
document. *)

Exercise 7. Finally, carry out the derivation for the semantics of the
expression

  Part 2: Pen and paper exercises, dynamic vs. lexical semantics

The derivations you'll be constructing for these exercises can get
*very complicated* -- as long as 33 lines for exercise 12 -- so you'll
want to do them on paper, and check parts as you go.  *)

Exercise 8: For each of the following expressions, derive its final

pen and paper, and label them with the name of the evaluation rule

just use it directly. Each expression should be evaluated in an
initially empty environment.

This derivation shows the value of the expression as 42. But OCaml
evaluates it to 63:

    # let x = ref 42 in (x := !x - 21; !x) + !x ;;
    - : int = 63

Why is this? The difference arises from the order in which OCaml
evaluates the arguments of binary operators. In an expression of the
form `P + Q`, OCaml evaluates Q, then P, then computes the sum: 

    E,S ⊢ P + Q ⇓
                ∣ E, S ⊢ Q ⇓ n, S′
                | E, S′ ⊢ P ⇓ m, S′′
                ⇓ m + n, S′′

(or equivalently,

    E,S ⊢ P + Q ⇓
                | E, S′ ⊢ P ⇓ m, S′′
                ∣ E, S ⊢ Q ⇓ n, S′
                ⇓ m + n, S′′                   )

But the R_+ rule, repeated here for reference, specifies that the
evaluation of P and Q occur in the opposite order:

    E,S ⊢ P + Q ⇓
                | E, S ⊢ P ⇓ m, S′
                ∣ E, S′ ⊢ Q ⇓ n, S′′
                ⇓ m + n, S′′

The difference between these two rules, pertinent only in the presence
of side effects, may remind you of the lab puzzle from labs 12 and
13. *)

  Part 3: Implementing environments

To represent an environment, we need to maintain a mapping from
variable names to their values. For simplicity, we will consider only
integer values here. In this part, you'll work on an especially simple
implementation of environments. (Something like this may prove useful
in implementing the final project!) A variable will be represented as
a string, and an environment will be represented as an "association
list" made of pairs of variables and their integer values.

The `List` module has some functions useful for manipulating
association lists. You may want to make use of them here. See
<https://v2.ocaml.org/api/List.html#1_Associationlists>.  
 *)

type varid = string ;;
type value = int ;;
type env = (varid * value) list ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 13: Write a function `empty : unit -> env` that returns an
empty environment.
....................................................................*)

let empty () : env = [] ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 14: Write a function `extend : env -> varid -> value -> env`
that extends an environment; that is, `extend e x v` should return an
environment that maps variables to values just as `e` does *except*
that it maps `x` to `v`. Make sure to handle the case where `x` is
already in the environment.
....................................................................*)

let extend (e : env) (x : varid) (v : value) : env =
  (x, v) :: (List.remove_assoc x e) ;;

(*....................................................................
Exercise 15: Write a function `lookup : env -> varid -> value` that
returns the value of a variable in the given environment, raising a
`Not_found` exception if the variable has no value in the environment.
....................................................................*)

let lookup : varid -> env -> value =
  List.assoc ;;

(* The requested function is already implemented in the `List` library
   as `List.assoc`, including the returning of the `Not_found`
   exception, so we just use it directly here. *)
